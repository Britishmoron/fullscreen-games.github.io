Hello, I am BritishMoron (couldn't think of a name) and I just want to make games.
Thats about it.
In order to install any of the games here there is a proccess.
First, install "home.html" from main.
2nd, install release Territorial.io unblocked.
3rd, install "sandboxels.html" from main.
4th, install any other games from main or HTML Games that seem nice.
5th, open "home.html" from your files or file explorer.
6th, finally, click one of the links to the games you have installed.
Note: I do not own some of these games! a few are simply unblocked!
