Hello, I am the creator of TzA Industries, and I just want to make games.
Thats about it.
In order to install any of the games here there is a proccess.
Simply install release HTML Game Pack from my releases, and open the folder from the .zip file installed.
Next open "home.html" and click a link to go to your new games!
If you cannot use the games from the release for some reason, use the alternate proccess below.
First, install "home.html" from main.
2nd, install release Territorial.html.
3rd, install "sandboxels.html" from main.
4th, install any other games from main or HTML Games that seem nice.
5th, open "home.html" from your files or file explorer.
6th, finally, click one of the links to the games you have installed.
Note: I do not own some of these games! a few are simply unblocked!
